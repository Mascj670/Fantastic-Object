# Fantastic-Object
A project I would love to create if I weren't limited by time, technology, or money would be a Bluetooth digital alarm clock that can also operate as a speaker and a nightlight. Encased in an amber-colored rock salt (salt-lamp) while seated on a thick piece of marble, the device would have an LED screen to display the time. The bottom of the clock would project LED lights through the salt crystals.
	The Bluetooth capabilities would allow the alarm clock to connect to your phone's Spotify. Depending on the tempo of the music, the alarm clock would change colors through “dance mode.” “Dance mode” would activate through the utilization of Spotify's API to identify the beat of the song. You would also be able to remotely operate the clock via any Bluetooth-enabled device.
	I am interested in pursuing this project because I am fascinated with the coding requirements needed to make this object change colors. I would love to one day create something even remotely similar to this. This idea is influenced by a conversation I had with one of my high school friends, who now goes to UVA for computer science. He told me about a UVA student who coded this light. After this conversation, I realized the amount of work required to create and program something, even as "rudimentary" as a light. This curiosity inspired me to take this class. Link to Vinay Bhaip, the student who inspired the idea, his site is definitely worth a look over for anyone in this class!!
